ðŸ’§ Classification of Groundwater Using Multi-Model Stacking Technique
ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

Groundwater is a critical resource for millions of people, especially in rural and semi-urban areas. However, rapid industrialization and agricultural expansion have led to widespread contamination, making groundwater assessment an urgent necessity.
This project presents an automated groundwater potability classification system that leverages machine learning and ensemble learning techniques to evaluate whether water is safe for human consumption based on physicochemical indicators.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To design and develop an ensemble-based machine learning framework using a multi-model stacking technique that classifies groundwater as potable or non-potable by integrating multiple predictive models for enhanced accuracy and generalization.

ðŸ§  Methodology

a) Data Collection and Preprocessing

Utilized groundwater quality datasets containing parameters such as pH, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Hardness, Chlorides, Nitrates, Sulfates, and Conductivity.

Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions, outliers, and correlations.

Applied preprocessing techniques such as imputation for missing values and normalization using StandardScaler / MinMaxScaler.

b) Model Development

Implemented multiple supervised learning algorithms:

1. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

2. Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)

3. Extra Trees Classifier

4. CatBoost Classifier

Each base model learns distinct data patterns and contributes unique insights to the final prediction.

c) Multi-Model Stacking Ensemble

Combined base model predictions using a meta-learner (stacking classifier) to form an integrated decision model.

The meta-learner learns from the outputs of individual classifiers to minimize errors and improve prediction confidence.

d) Evaluation Metrics

Models were assessed using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

Comparative analysis confirmed the superiority of the stacking classifier over individual models.
